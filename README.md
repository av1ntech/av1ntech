<h1>Hi, I'm Marvin! Your aspiring QA/Software Tester <br/><a </a></h1>

<h2>About me</h2>

I have a degree in Bachelor Of Science In Information Technology. I graduated in STI College Caloocan S.Y 2022-2023 with High Honors and our Group won a Best Capstone/Thesis in our campus.
I love playing computer games and at the same time I am hooked in to active sports. So as a gamer I am really hooked when testing new things so therefore I've decided that my career path focuses more on application testing.

<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Projects that I've tested:</h2>

- <b> ARIS: AN EDUCATIONAL STORY BOOK MOBILE APPLICATION USING AUGMENTED REALITY FOR PRESCHOOLERS 
OF BEBOT CHILD CARE AND TUTORIAL CENTER (IT CAPSTONE 2023)</b>
